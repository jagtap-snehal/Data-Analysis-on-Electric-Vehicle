# Data-Analysis-on-Electric-Vehicle

This project focuses on the analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data, involving exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and creating animated plots to visualize the trends in EV adoption across different locations and makes over the years. The work involves tasks such as univariate and bivariate analysis, choropleth maps, and racing bar plots to gain deeper insights into the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about Electric Vehicles (EVs) with various attributes like location, year, make, etc. The data helps analyze the trends in EV adoption and distribution across various regions.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This task includes:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing the distribution of single variables in the dataset to understand the spread and summary statistics.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Studying the relationships between two variables to identify trends and patterns, such as the number of EVs by year or location.

### Task 2: Choropleth Map Visualization

Using **Plotly Express**, we created a choropleth map to visualize the number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) based on geographical locations. This provides a geographical perspective on EV adoption across different regions.

- **Library Used**: `plotly.express`
- **Visualization**: Choropleth map depicting the distribution of EVs by region.

### Task 3: Racing Bar Plot Animation

This task involves creating an animated **Racing Bar Plot** to visualize the yearly changes in the count of EVs for different makes over time.

- **Library Used**: `plotly.express` 
- **Visualization**: Animated racing bar plot displaying the count of EVs by make for each year.

### Task 4: LinkedIn Post

A LinkedIn post was created to share the experience and findings of the project, tagging [Innomatics Research Labs](https://www.innomatics.in/).

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preparation.
- **Plotly Express**: For creating interactive and animated visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For performing the analysis and visualizations in an interactive environment.
